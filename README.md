Title:<br/>
"Formalisation and validation through Coloured Petri Nets of a bio-inspired coordination model for swarms of robots"

Abstract:<br/>
Multi-robots and swarms of robots systems, especially those that have bio-inspired techniques, lack a formal method for modelling and analysis. The problem lies in the fact that bio-inspired algorithms are intrinsically hard to be analysed due to their evolutionary nature, and this difficulty increases when these algorithms are applied to swarms. In this work, the application of Coloured Petri Nets is proposed to carry out the formal validation of the coordination model for swarm of robots IACA-DI, which was proposed for surveillance, coverage, foraging and search-and-rescue tasks. According to the outcomes, it was possible to demonstrate that the basic requirements for a swarm robotics coordination model were achieved. This is due to the fact that the Petri net has proven that the system is very reliable, has no deadlocks and has the restartability property, which is very important for the proposed task.
